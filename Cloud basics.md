### Components of a cloud platform

- Parts of a cloud
- Monolithic and loosely coupled systems
- Requests, responses, and APIs

### Cloud Basics and Parts of a Cloud

## What is Cloud?

 - Cloud stores data
 - Cloud can be used to compute hard math problems
 - Cloud can combine specialized systems for complex tasks

### Terminologies

*Compute* - Any computer operation requires some computation in a CPU.

*Server* - A specialised computer for cloud and web servers.

*Instance* -  A computational unit which may be a physical server or a virtual server that is abstracted by a cloud service.

*Autoscaling Group* - A type of cluster that can increase or decrease the number of instances based on demand.

## Monolithic and Loosely Coupled Systems

### Tightly Coupled

They are systems  that are quick to stand but might result in a lot of technical debt.

#### Technical debt 

Cost of doing something using the easier option now instead of an option that might take longer but might require a lot of redoing later.
May also be caused by poor documentation and lack of comments on code.

### Loosely Coupled 

These are systems that more time upfront but are generally easier to improve on as we continue building.

### Microservices

These are individual specialized systems designed to accompish a specific task. It is software deployed on specialized infrastructure.

## Request Response and APIs

Client :left_right_arrow: Server model - Request:left_right_arrow: Response model

### HTTP Responses

After the server processes the request a response is sent
A response can any type of data HTML files, Javascript , CSS , Images , Videos 

### Response Status and Type

#### HTTP status code 

- 200 - Request successful
- 400 - Bad request
- 401 - Unauthorized
- 404 - Not found
